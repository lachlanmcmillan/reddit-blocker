# Reddit Blocker

This browser extension blocks the feed on the reddit homepage, /r/all, and can optionally block the feed of any other subreddit you choose. 

While Reddit is an invaluable source of knowledge and information covering a wide array of topics, it's easy to get distracted by memes, current events, and other potentially time-wasting content once you've found what you initially sought. This extension aims to help you avoid falling into the trap of endless scrolling by removing the feed from the reddit homepage altogether.

Compatible with old.reddit.com and www.reddit.com.

Inspired by Unhook and other extensions which block the Youtube homepage.
